# Contributing to Terminal News Application

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the [README.md](README.md) with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with notes on your changes
3. Increase the version numbers in pyproject.toml following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
4. Ensure all tests pass and coverage remains above 70%

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Run `black` and `isort` before committing

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-news-app/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** typically have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 100 character line limit
* Snake_case for variables and functions
- PascalCase for classes
